## Overview

The Mining Rights NFT Emission Protocol creates a structured system where:
1. Miners purchase rights tokens that grant mining privileges
2. Successfully mined blocks can be converted into NFTs
3. Rights tokens persist and can be used for future mining
4. Protocol maintains economic balance through a fee structure

## Features

- **Rights-based Mining System**
  - Purchase mining rights tokens
  - Rights tokens required for NFT claims
  - Transferable mining rights
  - Configurable validity periods

- **Automated NFT Emission**
  - Block-based NFT generation
  - Verifiable mining proofs
  - Automated distribution system
  - Customizable NFT properties

- **Economic Framework**
  - Structured pricing model
  - Service fee distribution
  - Self-sustaining emission funding
  - Scalable economic model

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ergo node (fully synced)
- Ergo wallet with sufficient funds
- Mining software compatible with rights verification

### Installation
1. Set up an Ergo node
2. Configure mining software
3. Prepare wallet for rights token purchase

## Protocol Stages

### 1. Rights Sale Stage
- Purchase mining rights tokens
- Minimum purchase requirements
- Maximum rights per address limits
- Service fee processing

### 2. Mining Rights Holding Stage
- Token validity verification
- Rights token management
- Balance monitoring

### 3. Block Discovery Stage
- Block finding verification
- Confirmation requirements
- Claim window management

### 4. NFT Emission Stage
- NFT generation rules
- Distribution mechanism
- Metadata assignment

## Architecture

### Key Components
```
Protocol Structure
├── Rights Sale Contract
├── Block Discovery Contract
├── NFT Emission Contract
└── Protocol Management
```

### Register Structure
- R4: Price/Properties
- R5: Fee/Parameters
- R6: Addresses
- R7: Token IDs

## Economic Model

### Price Structure
```
Rights Token Price = Base Price + Service Fee + Mint Funding

Where:
- Base Price: Core token value
- Service Fee: Protocol maintenance
- Mint Funding: NFT emission costs
```

### Fee Distribution
```
Purchase Amount
├── Protocol Wallet (Service Fee)
├── Emission Contract (Mint Funding)
└── User (Rights Tokens)
```

## Technical Requirements

### System Requirements
- Ergo node v4.0.8+
- Memory: 4GB RAM minimum
- Storage: 10GB available space
- Network: Stable internet connection

### Mining Software Requirements
- Compatible mining software
- Rights token verification capability
- Block submission modifications

## Security Considerations

### Rights Token Security
- Keep private keys secure
- Monitor token balances
- Verify transaction signatures

### Mining Security
- Verify block submissions
- Check confirmation requirements
- Monitor claim windows

### Protocol Security
- Double-spending prevention
- Front-running protection
- Fee verification
